# FCT All Files

The annotated master file tree showing every possible file and folder that may appear inside a CAB anchor, with each named element wiki-linked to its governing facet spec.

An anchor is a standardized folder structure that serves as the home for a project, topic, or content area.
See [[CAB Base]] shows files common to all anchors.

> **Note:** This file serves as the reference example itself — the annotated file tree below IS the canonical illustration of a complete anchor structure.

## Software Design Documents

Software project anchors use four design documents in Plan/. These are specification-only — they contain the current design, not the history of how it was reached.

{NAME} PRD.md — **Product Requirements** — Defines what the product does: goals, user stories, scope, constraints, success criteria. The PRD also contains a design workflow table (see below) that links to the other design documents and describes their sequence.

{NAME} Triage.md — **Triage** — Agent-owned inbox showing the **status of the anchor** — every item except those in `## Later` and `## Icebox`, grouped by workflow state (Active / Ready / Now / Next), in source order from the backlog. Status brackets carry counts (`**[3 Questions]**`, `**[Verify]**`). H1 banner has an anchor TAG (`[U]` / `[A]` / `[U+A]` / `[G]` / `[?]` / `[]`) plus pipe-grouped totals. À la carte questions live in the sibling `{NAME} Questions.md` facet; Triage just carries a bullet line linking to it. Destructively rewritten on each `/ask` or `/triage` run; the user reads and responds with shorthand.

{NAME} Questions.md — **Questions** — Agent-owned facet for **à la carte** (cross-cutting, anchor-level, agent-raised) questions that don't belong to any feature doc. Same `## Open Questions` block format as feature docs (per [[SKA ask]]); same Phase 1 / 2 / 3 lifecycle. Created on first à la carte `/ask` against the anchor; updated on every à la carte `/ask`.

{NAME} UX Design.md — **UX Design** — Specifies screens, navigation flows, user interactions, and visual layout. Current spec only — no rationale or alternatives.

{NAME} System Design.md — **System Design** — Specifies system architecture, component boundaries, data models, APIs, and technical decisions. Current spec only — no rationale or alternatives.

{NAME} Discussion.md — **Discussion** (optional) — Extended conversations about design choices, trade-offs, and redesign decisions. This is the place for "why" and "what we considered." Use dated sections. Unlike the other design docs, this file is a log, not a specification.


### Design Workflow

The PRD should include a workflow table like this to orient readers:

| Step | Document | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | {NAME} PRD.md | Clarify requirements and scope |
| 2 | {NAME} Triage.md | Inbox of items needing user input (auto-generated) |
| 3 | {NAME} UX Design.md | Design user-facing experience |
| 4 | {NAME} System Design.md | Design technical architecture |
| 5 | {NAME} Files.md + Dev/ | File tree and module docs |
| 6 | {NAME} Roadmap.md | Implementation milestones |
| 7 | Dispatch tree | Verify all docs reachable from Docs.md (see [[CAB Docs]]) |

Steps are iterative — resolving open questions may require revisiting the PRD or UX design.

# BRIEF

- **This file is the canonical illustration of a complete CAB anchor file tree** — it is itself the reference example, not just a description of one. Every name in the tree wiki-links to the facet spec that governs that name.
- **NOT a place to author facet semantics.** Each named file/folder gets ONE line of inline annotation max; full semantics, rules, and shape live in the linked `CAB <Facet>.md` (`[[CAB Backlog]]`, `[[FCT Anchor Page]]`, etc.). Don't grow this page into a multi-paragraph spec for any single facet.
- **Inclusion test for adding a row:** the element is a recognized CAB anchor file/folder (named via the `{NAME}` / `{CAB Folder}` placeholders) that can legitimately appear in *some* anchor. One-off project-specific files do NOT belong here.
- **Naming conventions:** placeholders use `{NAME}` for the anchor name and `{CAB Folder}` for the folder name; wiki-link the canonical facet, aliased to the on-disk filename when the link target differs (e.g. `[[FCT Anchor Page|{NAME}.md]]`). Preserve the box-drawing characters (`├──`, `│`, `└──`) — the monospace `cssclasses` frontmatter is load-bearing for tree rendering.
- **Two trees live here**: the anchor folder tree (top) and the optional Code Repository tree (bottom, separated by `─── Optional ... ───`). Keep them separated; don't merge code-repo files into the anchor tree.
- **Load-bearing cross-references** — `CAB Base.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `CAB Rules.md` index this file's contents per the SKA CLAUDE.md cross-reference checklist. When adding or removing a named element here, verify the corresponding dispatch tables in those three files stay in sync.
- **Software Design Documents section is descriptive, not prescriptive** — the per-document paragraphs orient readers to the four (now six) Plan/ design docs; the authoritative shape of each lives in its own `CAB <Facet>.md`. Don't drift those summaries away from the linked specs.
